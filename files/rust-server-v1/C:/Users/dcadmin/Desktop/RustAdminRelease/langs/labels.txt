Warning
You are connecting to your server via the 'Experimental' rcon type.
The support for this rcon type has been discontinued and can cause instabilities and crashes.
It is strongly advised to switch to the rcon type 'WebRcon' via the settings tab. You will need to configure your server variable rcon.web = 1 and restart your server so that the changes are taken into account.
Switching to the WebRcon should not change anything on how you use your server and/or RustAdmin. It is just the most recent way of communication between your server and any RCON client.
Please update the program first.
